# Smart Data Aggregator

## Description
The Smart Data Aggregator tool is designed to manage and analyze large sets of user data efficiently. This project focuses on different types of collections in Python, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, to perform various tasks such as real-time analytics, data tracking, and reporting.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: User Data Processing with Lists
- **Functionality:**
  - Filters users older than 30 from specific countries (USA, Canada).
  - Extracts their names into a new list.
  - Sorts the user list by age and finds duplicate names.

### Part 2: Immutable Data Management with Tuples
- **Functionality:**
  - Manages transaction data stored as immutable tuples.
  - Counts unique users involved in transactions.
  - Identifies the transaction with the highest amount.
  - Separates transaction IDs and user IDs.

### Part 3: Unique Data Handling with Sets
- **Functionality:**
  - Manages unique user IDs who visited certain pages.
  - Finds users who visited both Page A and Page B.
  - Updates the user set for Page A and removes IDs from Page B.

### Part 4: Data Aggregation with Dictionaries
- **Functionality:**
  - Collects user feedback using dictionaries.
  - Filters users who rated 4 or higher and sorts the feedback.
  - Combines feedback from multiple dictionaries and handles updates.
